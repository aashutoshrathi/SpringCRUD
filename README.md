# CRUD with SpringBoot
Basic CRUD operations with help of SpringBoot + Hibernate with goodness of JPA Repository.

## Features
- Use of complete MVC Architecture
- Uses CRUD Repository
- Custom Error Handler (`exception/CustomExceptionHandler.java`)
- Connection with PostgreSQL
- Validation of input fields using JavaX API.

## How to run?

```shell script
mvn install
java -jar target/basicuser-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Why?
I have worked for about a year with NestJS and TypeORM, I read somewhere that MVC pattern followed in that stack was inspired from SpringBoot + Hibernate.

I gave it a try, and found out the similarities and they have same structure of files and even same decorators in most cases.
